## 3 differences between web2 and web3

If you're active on social media, you would probably have heard of web3.0, or thirdweb. Basically, it's a new iteration of the World Wide Web that is based on decentralization (Decentralisation simply means information and resources available and shared by everybody instead of being in control by a single person or entity.)

I was inquisitive to know more about web3.0 and Blockchain technology as a whole, so I registered for the [blockgames program](https://blockgames.gg) organised by [zuri.team](https://zuri.team) in collaboration with [Nestcoin](https://nestcoin.com) which will run for about 2 months. (and I'll be documenting most of my knowledge as I learn here as simple as possible, so watch out :-) )

Okay so... Now to the differences between web2.0 and web3.0: 

### 1. Type of Application

The types of apps on web2.0 are two-way webpages. That simply means the communication is between the client, and the server alone e.g e-commerce sites, static blogs, and so on. On web3.0, it's different. The apps are 'smart' and can make use of artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities making the sites that run on them more versatile.

### 2. Technologies used

web2.0 makes use of tech like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and AJAX to power many websites and applications. This, which we all know, is the same old generic stuff. On web3.0, there is the adaptation of more state-of-the-art technologies, which help to achieve decentralization.

### 3. Intention

web2.0 is all about building relationships and enhancing communication between humans. web3.0 on the other hand, helps these relationships and conversations have a 'mind' of their own. It studies human behaviour, and interacts with it to develop it self.

Those are the three basic differences I learnt about, and hopefully I was able to convey them as simple as possible.
