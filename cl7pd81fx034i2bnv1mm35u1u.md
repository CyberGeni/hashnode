## I joined a Twitter challenge...

Just before the weekend I saw a tweet from [Gift](https://twitter.com/codingossy/status/1565239107034439681?t=kBAVzGsASdXAe7PhFWmQ-A&s=19) about a frontend challenge that'd run from September 1st to September 15th. We're to recreate a Cryptocurrency landing page from a slightly complicated figma design. Once I saw the tweet, I just knew I had to hop on it because, why not? I've never joined an online challenge before and I don't exactly post stuffs I've built (for some undertermined reason). This had to be the motivation, inspiration and external push I needed to start putting myself out there. So I did it :-)

### what I built...

Well basically it's a landing page of a fictional cryptocurrency website gotten from the Figma Open Source Design community. Some of the 'features' are:

- responsiveness across multiple screen sizes
- some very sleek scroll and fade animations (yeah I'm proud of myself for actually implementing those:))
- making sure that the implementation looks as closely as possible to the figma designs

Yeah not too many features as expected right? Well there were somethings I did to get the result looking pretty cool.

### the process...

So I built this project with HTML and TailwindCSS mainly, then a sprinkle of JavaScript. Now when I say sprinkle I really mean it because there's probably not more than 20 lines of code on there.

The fade-in scroll animations are powered by a lightweight JavaScript library called [ScrollReveal](https://scrollrevealjs.org). Pretty cool and intuitive, you should check it out if you haven't.
